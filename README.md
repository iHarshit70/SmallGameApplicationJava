# SmallGameApplicationJava
Two games are been applied in this application the guessing game and the rock, paper &amp; scissor game.

These are the games we have mostly played in our childhood and many of us have tried to create a program of it too. Here I have done the same just the changes made here are I have made this game as an application that gives more user interface to the game, and the tough job was to create the rock, paper & scissor game as I have just given button here to select and not taking any kind input from user itâ€™s a game of click here for users, for input the number guessing game is there where you can guess the number in 5 chances
